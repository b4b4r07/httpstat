## Usage

```console
$ bash ./httpstat.sh --help
Usage: httpstat URL [CURL_OPTIONS]
       httpstat -h | --help
       httpstat --version
Arguments:
  URL     url to request, could be with or without `http(s)://` prefix
Options:
  CURL_OPTIONS  any curl supported options, except for -w -D -o -S -s,
                which are already used internally.
  -h --help     show this screen.
  --version     show version.
Environments:
  HTTPSTAT_SHOW_BODY    By default httpstat will write response body
                        in a tempfile, but you can let it print out by setting
                        this variable to `true`.
  HTTPSTAT_SHOW_SPEED   set to `true` to show download and upload speed.
```

This `httpstat` is written by bash only. Do you have `/bin/bash` and the like?
